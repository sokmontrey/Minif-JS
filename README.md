# Minif-JS

## Mini Javascript front-end Framework (sort of).
Originally created for the school website assignment. Minif-JS is a framework that is entirely based in the front-end static site code base without the help of NodeJS.
MinifJS was meant to have StateManagement, Page(similar to Route), EventListener, Loop, and Condition for a simple website that dynamically changed with a scalable source code.
But I continue to work on this project to improve my Javascript skill and hopefully gain some knowlegdge in pattern design.

The website that was built with MinifJS V2: [Emery Sport](https://emerysport.netlify.app).
