A mini JavaScript front-end framework written from scratch for school's website project assignment.

I just got an assignment to build a website for my school in HTML/CSS/JS. I need a framework to help me build the website. There are nothing wrong with existed framework. I just need a simple, lightweight, and ralatively scalable framework for the developement of the website. So I decide to create my own Javascript framework to improve my Javascript and OOP knowledges with the inspiration from ReactJS.
